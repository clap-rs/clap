//! `clap` is a simple-to-use, efficient, and full-featured library for parsing command line
//! arguments and subcommands when writing console/terminal applications.
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! `clap` is used to parse *and validate* the string of command line arguments provided by the user
//! at runtime. You provide the list of valid possibilities, and `clap` handles the rest. This means
//! you focus on your *applications* functionality, and less on the parsing and validating of
//! arguments.
//!
//! `clap` also provides the traditional version and help switches (or flags) 'for free' meaning
//! automatically with no configuration. It does this by checking the list of valid possibilities you
//! supplied and adding only the ones you haven't already defined. If you are using subcommands,
//! `clap` will also auto-generate a `help` subcommand for you in addition to the traditional flags.
//!
//! Once `clap` parses the user provided string of arguments, it returns the matches along with any
//! applicable values. If the user made an error or typo, `clap` informs them of the mistake and
//! exits gracefully (or returns a `Result` type and allows you to perform any clean up prior to
//! exit). Because of this, you can make reasonable assumptions in your code about the validity of
//! the arguments.
//!
//!
//! ## Quick Example
//!
//! The following examples show a quick example of some of the very basic functionality of `clap`. For more advanced usage, such as requirements, conflicts, groups, multiple values and occurrences see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/clap/), [examples/](examples) directory of this repository or the [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLza5oFLQGTl2Z5T8g1pRkIynR3E0_pc7U).
//! 
//! **NOTE:** All of these examples are functionally the same, but show different styles in which to use `clap`. These different styles are purely a matter of personal preference.
//! 
//! The first example shows the simplest way to use `clap`, by defining a struct. If you're familiar with the `structopt` crate you're in luck, it's the same! (In fact it's the exact same code running under the covers!)
//! 
//! ```rust
//! // (Full example with detailed comments in examples/01d_quick_example.rs)
//! //
//! // This example demonstrates clap's full 'custom derive' style of creating arguments which is the
//! // simplest method of use, but sacrifices some flexibility.
//! use clap::Clap;
//! 
//! /// This doc string acts as a help message when the user runs '--help'
//! /// as do all doc strings on fields
//! #[derive(Clap)]
//! #[clap(version = "1.0", author = "Kevin K.")]
//! struct Opts {
//!     /// Sets a custom config file. Could have been an Option<T> with no default too
//!     #[clap(short = "c", long = "config", default_value = "default.conf")]
//!     config: String,
//!     /// Some input. Because this isn't an Option<T> it's required to be used
//!     input: String,
//!     /// A level of verbosity, and can be used multiple times
//!     #[clap(short = "v", long = "verbose", parse(from_occurrences))]
//!     verbose: i32,
//!     #[clap(subcommand)]
//!     subcmd: SubCommand,
//! }
//! 
//! #[derive(Clap)]
//! enum SubCommand {
//!     /// A help message for the Test subcommand
//!     #[clap(name = "test", version = "1.3", author = "Someone Else")]
//!     Test(Test),
//! }
//! 
//! /// A subcommand for controlling testing
//! #[derive(Clap)]
//! struct Test {
//!     /// Print debug info
//!     #[clap(short = "d")]
//!     debug: bool
//! }
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     let opts: Opts = Opts::parse();
//! 
//!     // Gets a value for config if supplied by user, or defaults to "default.conf"
//!     println!("Value for config: {}", opts.config);
//!     println!("Using input file: {}", opts.input);
//! 
//!     // Vary the output based on how many times the user used the "verbose" flag
//!     // (i.e. 'myprog -v -v -v' or 'myprog -vvv' vs 'myprog -v'
//!     match opts.verbose {
//!         0 => println!("No verbose info"),
//!         1 => println!("Some verbose info"),
//!         2 => println!("Tons of verbose info"),
//!         3 | _ => println!("Don't be crazy"),
//!     }
//! 
//!     // You can handle information about subcommands by requesting their matches by name
//!     // (as below), requesting just the name used, or both at the same time
//!     match opts.subcmd {
//!         SubCommand::Test(t) => {
//!             if t.debug {
//!                 println!("Printing debug info...");
//!             } else {
//!                 println!("Printing normally...");
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//! 
//!     // more program logic goes here...
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! This second method shows a method using the 'Builder Pattern' which allows more advanced configuration options (not shown in this small example), or even dynamically generating arguments when desired. The downside is it's more verbose.
//! 
//! ```rust
//! // (Full example with detailed comments in examples/01a_quick_example.rs)
//! //
//! // This example demonstrates clap's "builder pattern" method of creating arguments
//! // which the most flexible, but also most verbose.
//! use clap::{Arg, App, SubCommand};
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     let matches = App::new("My Super Program")
//!                           .version("1.0")
//!                           .author("Kevin K. <kbknapp@gmail.com>")
//!                           .about("Does awesome things")
//!                           .arg(Arg::with_name("config")
//!                                .short('c')
//!                                .long("config")
//!                                .value_name("FILE")
//!                                .help("Sets a custom config file")
//!                                .takes_value(true))
//!                           .arg(Arg::with_name("INPUT")
//!                                .help("Sets the input file to use")
//!                                .required(true)
//!                                .index(1))
//!                           .arg(Arg::with_name("v")
//!                                .short('v')
//!                                .multiple(true)
//!                                .help("Sets the level of verbosity"))
//!                           .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name("test")
//!                                       .about("controls testing features")
//!                                       .version("1.3")
//!                                       .author("Someone E. <someone_else@other.com>")
//!                                       .arg(Arg::with_name("debug")
//!                                           .short('d')
//!                                           .help("print debug information verbosely")))
//!                           .get_matches();
//! 
//!     // Same as above examples...
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! The next example shows a far less verbose method, but sacrifices some of the advanced configuration options (not shown in this small example). This method also takes a *very* minor runtime penalty.
//! 
//! ```rust
//! // (Full example with detailed comments in examples/01a_quick_example.rs)
//! //
//! // This example demonstrates clap's "usage strings" method of creating arguments
//! // which is less verbose
//! use clap::{Arg, App, SubCommand};
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     let matches = App::new("myapp")
//!                           .version("1.0")
//!                           .author("Kevin K. <kbknapp@gmail.com>")
//!                           .about("Does awesome things")
//!                           .args_from_usage(
//!                               "-c, --config=[FILE] 'Sets a custom config file'
//!                               <INPUT>              'Sets the input file to use'
//!                               -v...                'Sets the level of verbosity'")
//!                           .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name("test")
//!                                       .about("controls testing features")
//!                                       .version("1.3")
//!                                       .author("Someone E. <someone_else@other.com>")
//!                                       .arg("-d, --debug 'Print debug information'"))
//!                           .get_matches();
//! 
//!     // Same as previous example...
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! This third method shows how you can use a YAML file to build your CLI and keep your Rust source tidy
//! or support multiple localized translations by having different YAML files for each localization.
//! 
//! First, create the `cli.yml` file to hold your CLI options, but it could be called anything we like:
//! 
//! ```yaml
//! name: myapp
//! version: "1.0"
//! author: Kevin K. <kbknapp@gmail.com>
//! about: Does awesome things
//! args:
//!     - config:
//!         short: c
//!         long: config
//!         value_name: FILE
//!         help: Sets a custom config file
//!         takes_value: true
//!     - INPUT:
//!         help: Sets the input file to use
//!         required: true
//!         index: 1
//!     - verbose:
//!         short: v
//!         multiple: true
//!         help: Sets the level of verbosity
//! subcommands:
//!     - test:
//!         about: controls testing features
//!         version: "1.3"
//!         author: Someone E. <someone_else@other.com>
//!         args:
//!             - debug:
//!                 short: d
//!                 help: print debug information
//! ```
//! 
//! Since this feature requires additional dependencies that not everyone may want, it is *not* compiled in by default and we need to enable a feature flag in Cargo.toml:
//! 
//! Simply change your `clap = "3.0.0-beta.1"` to `clap = {version = "3.0.0-beta.1", features = ["yaml"]}`.
//! 
//! Finally we create our `main.rs` file just like we would have with the previous two examples:
//! 
//! ```rust
//! // (Full example with detailed comments in examples/17_yaml.rs)
//! //
//! // This example demonstrates clap's building from YAML style of creating arguments which is far
//! // more clean, but takes a very small performance hit compared to the other two methods.
//! use clap::{App, load_yaml};
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     // The YAML file is found relative to the current file, similar to how modules are found
//!     let yaml = load_yaml!("cli.yml");
//!     let matches = App::from(yaml).get_matches();
//! 
//!     // Same as previous examples...
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! If you were to compile any of the above programs and run them with the flag `--help` or `-h` (or `help` subcommand, since we defined `test` as a subcommand) the following would be output (except the first example where the help message sort of explains the Rust code).
//! 
//! ```sh
//! $ myprog --help
//! My Super Program 1.0
//! Kevin K. <kbknapp@gmail.com>
//! Does awesome things
//! 
//! ARGS:
//!     INPUT    The input file to use
//! 
//! USAGE:
//!     MyApp [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <INPUT> [SUBCOMMAND]
//! 
//! FLAGS:
//!     -h, --help       Prints help information
//!     -v               Sets the level of verbosity
//!     -V, --version    Prints version information
//! 
//! OPTIONS:
//!     -c, --config <FILE>    Sets a custom config file
//! 
//! SUBCOMMANDS:
//!     help    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
//!     test    Controls testing features
//! ```
//! 
//! **NOTE:** You could also run `myapp test --help` or `myapp help test` to see the help message for the `test` subcommand.
//!
//! ## Try it!
//!
//! ### Pre-Built Test
//!
//! To try out the pre-built example, use the following steps:
//!
//! * Clone the repository `$ git clone https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs && cd clap-rs/tests`
//! * Compile the example `$ cargo build --release`
//! * Run the help info `$ ./target/release/claptests --help`
//! * Play with the arguments!
//!
//! ### BYOB (Build Your Own Binary)
//!
//! To test out `clap`'s default auto-generated help/version follow these steps:
//!
//! * Create a new cargo project `$ cargo new fake --bin && cd fake`
//! * Add `clap` to your `Cargo.toml`
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! clap = "2"
//! ```
//!
//! * Add the following to your `src/main.rs`
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use clap::App;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!   App::new("fake").version("v1.0-beta").get_matches();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! * Build your program `$ cargo build --release`
//! * Run with help or version `$ ./target/release/fake --help` or `$ ./target/release/fake
//! --version`
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! For full usage, add `clap` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` (it is **highly** recommended to
//! use the `~major.minor.patch` style versions in your `Cargo.toml`, for more information see
//! [Compatibility Policy](#compatibility-policy)) to use from crates.io:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! clap = "~2.27.0"
//! ```
//!
//! Or get the latest changes from the master branch at github:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.clap]
//! git = "https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs.git"
//! ```
//!
//! Define a list of valid arguments for your program (see the
//! [documentation](https://docs.rs/clap/) or [examples/] directory of this repo)
//!
//! Then run `cargo build` or `cargo update && cargo build` for your project.
//!
//! ### Optional Dependencies / Features
//!
//! #### Features enabled by default
//!
//! * `derive`: Enables the custom derive (i.e. `#[derive(Clap)]`). Without this you must use one of the other methods of creating a `clap` CLI listed above
//! * `suggestions`: Turns on the `Did you mean '--myoption'?` feature for when users make typos. (builds dependency `strsim`)
//! * `color`: Turns on colored error messages. This feature only works on non-Windows OSs. (builds dependency `ansi-term`)
//!
//! To disable these, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.clap]
//! version = "~2.27.0"
//! default-features = false
//! ```
//!
//! You can also selectively enable only the features you'd like to include, by adding:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.clap]
//! version = "~2.27.0"
//! default-features = false
//!
//! # Cherry-pick the features you'd like to use
//! features = [ "suggestions", "color" ]
//! ```
//!
//! #### Opt-in features
//!
//! * **"yaml"**: Enables building CLIs from YAML documents. (builds dependency `yaml-rust`)
//! * **"unstable"**: Enables unstable `clap` features that may change from release to release
//! * **"wrap_help"**: Turns on the help text wrapping feature, based on the terminal size. (builds dependency `term-size`)
//!
//! ### Dependencies Tree
//!
//! The following graphic depicts `clap`s dependency graph (generated using
//! [cargo-graph](https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-graph)).
//!
//!  * **Dashed** Line: Optional dependency
//!  * **Red** Color: **NOT** included by default (must use cargo `features` to enable)
//!  * **Blue** Color: Dev dependency, only used while developing.

//!
//! ### More Information
//!
//! You can find complete documentation on the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/clap/) for this project.
//!
//! You can also find usage examples in the [examples/] directory of this repo.
//!
//! #### Video Tutorials
//!
//! There's also the video tutorial series [Argument Parsing with Rust v2][video tutorials].
//!
//! These videos slowly trickle out as I finish them and currently a work in progress.
//!
//! ## How to Contribute
//!
//! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clap-rs/clap/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start contributing.
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! There are a few goals of `clap` that I'd like to maintain throughout contributions. If your
//! proposed changes break, or go against any of these goals we'll discuss the changes further
//! before merging (but will *not* be ignored, all contributes are welcome!). These are by no means
//! hard-and-fast rules, as I'm no expert and break them myself from time to time (even if by
//! mistake or ignorance).
//!
//! * Remain backwards compatible when possible
//!   - If backwards compatibility *must* be broken, use deprecation warnings if at all possible before
//!   removing legacy code - This does not apply for security concerns
//! * Parse arguments quickly
//!   - Parsing of arguments shouldn't slow down usage of the main program - This is also true of
//!   generating help and usage information (although *slightly* less stringent, as the program is about
//!   to exit)
//! * Try to be cognizant of memory usage
//!   - Once parsing is complete, the memory footprint of `clap` should be low since the  main program
//!   is the star of the show
//! * `panic!` on *developer* error, exit gracefully on *end-user* error
//!
//! ### Compatibility Policy
//!
//! Because `clap` takes `SemVer` and compatibility seriously, this is the official policy regarding
//! breaking changes and previous versions of Rust.
//!
//! `clap` will pin the minimum required version of Rust to the CI builds. Bumping the minimum
//! version of Rust is considered a minor breaking change, meaning *at a minimum* the minor version
//! of `clap` will be bumped.
//!
//! In order to keep from being suprised of breaking changes, it is **highly** recommended to use
//! the `~major.minor.patch` style in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies] clap = "~2.27.0"
//! ```
//!
//! This will cause *only* the patch version to be updated upon a `cargo update` call, and therefore
//! cannot break due to new features, or bumped minimum versions of Rust.
//!
//! #### Minimum Version of Rust
//!
//! `clap` will officially support current stable Rust, minus two releases, but may work with prior
//! releases as well. For example, current stable Rust at the time of this writing is 1.21.0,
//! meaning `clap` is guaranteed to compile with 1.19.0 and beyond. At the 1.22.0 release, `clap`
//! will be guaranteed to compile with 1.20.0 and beyond, etc.
//!
//! Upon bumping the minimum version of Rust (assuming it's within the stable-2 range), it *must* be
//! clearly annotated in the `CHANGELOG.md`
