//! Example on how the `rename_all` parameter works.
//!
//! `rename_all` can be used to override the casing style used during argument
//! generation. By default the `kebab-case` style will be used but there are a wide
//! variety of other styles available.
//!
//! ## Supported styles overview:
//!
//! - **Camel Case**: Indicate word boundaries with uppercase letter, excluding
//!                   the first word.
//! - **Kebab Case**: Keep all letters lowercase and indicate word boundaries
//!                   with hyphens.
//! - **Pascal Case**: Indicate word boundaries with uppercase letter,
//!                    including the first word.
//! - **Screaming Snake Case**: Keep all letters uppercase and indicate word
//!                             boundaries with underscores.
//! - **Snake Case**: Keep all letters lowercase and indicate word boundaries
//!                   with underscores.
//! - **Verbatim**: Use the original attribute name defined in the code.
