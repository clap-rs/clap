/// Compute the display width of `text`
///
/// # Examples
///
/// **Note:** When the `unicode` Cargo feature is disabled, all characters are presumed to take up
/// 1 width.  With the feature enabled, function will correctly deal with [combining characters] in
/// their decomposed form (see [Unicode equivalence]).
///
/// An example of a decomposed character is “é”, which can be decomposed into: “e” followed by a
/// combining acute accent: “◌́”.  Without the `unicode` Cargo feature, every `char` has a width of
/// 1. This includes the combining accent:
///
/// ## Emojis and CJK Characters
///
/// Characters such as emojis and [CJK characters] used in the
/// Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages are seen as double-width,
/// even if the `unicode-width` feature is disabled:
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// The displayed width of a string cannot always be computed from the
/// string alone. This is because the width depends on the rendering
/// engine used. This is particularly visible with [emoji modifier
/// sequences] where a base emoji is modified with, e.g., skin tone or
/// hair color modifiers. It is up to the rendering engine to detect
/// this and to produce a suitable emoji.
///
/// A simple example is “❤️”, which consists of “❤” (U+2764: Black
/// Heart Symbol) followed by U+FE0F (Variation Selector-16). By
/// itself, “❤” is a black heart, but if you follow it with the
/// variant selector, you may get a wider red heart.
///
/// A more complex example would be “👨‍🦰” which should depict a man
/// with red hair. Here the computed width is too large — and the
/// width differs depending on the use of the `unicode-width` feature:
///
/// This happens because the grapheme consists of three code points:
/// “👨” (U+1F468: Man), Zero Width Joiner (U+200D), and “🦰”
/// (U+1F9B0: Red Hair). You can see them above in the test. With
/// `unicode-width` enabled, the ZWJ is correctly seen as having zero
/// width, without it is counted as a double-width character.
///
/// ## Terminal Support
///
/// Modern browsers typically do a great job at combining characters
/// as shown above, but terminals often struggle more. As an example,
/// Gnome Terminal version 3.38.1, shows “❤️” as a big red heart, but
/// shows "👨‍🦰" as “👨🦰”.
