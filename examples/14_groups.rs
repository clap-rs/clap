/// `ArgGroup`s are a family of related arguments and way for you to say, "Any of these arguments".
/// By placing arguments in a logical group, you can make easier requirement and exclusion rules
/// instead of having to list each individually, or when you want a rule to apply "any but not all"
/// arguments.
///
/// For instance, you can make an entire `ArgGroup` required, this means that one (and *only* one)
/// argument from that group must be present. Using more than one argument from an `ArgGroup` causes
/// a failure (graceful exit).
///
/// You can also do things such as name an `ArgGroup` as a confliction or requirement, meaning any
/// of the arguments that belong to that group will cause a failure if present, or must present
/// respectively.
///
/// Perhaps the most common use of `ArgGroup`s is to require one and *only* one argument to be
/// present out of a given set. Imagine that you had multiple arguments, and you want one of them to
/// be required, but making all of them required isn't feasible because perhaps they conflict with
/// each other. For example, lets say that you were building an application where one could set a
/// given version number by supplying a string with an option argument, i.e. `--set-ver v1.2.3`, you
/// also wanted to support automatically using a previous version number and simply incrementing one
/// of the three numbers. So you create three flags `--major`, `--minor`, and `--patch`. All of
/// these arguments shouldn't be used at one time but you want to specify that *at least one* of
/// them is used. For this, you can create a group.
