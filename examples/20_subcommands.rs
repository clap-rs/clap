// Working with subcommands is simple. There are a few key points to remember when working with
// subcommands in clap. First, SubCommands are really just Apps. This means they can have their own
// settings, version, authors, args, and even their own subcommands. The next thing to remember is
// that subcommands are set up in a tree like hierarchy.
//
// An ASCII art depiction may help explain this better. Using a fictional version of git as the demo
// subject. Imagine the following are all subcommands of git (note, the author is aware these aren't
// actually all subcommands in the real git interface, but it makes explanation easier)
//
//            Top Level App (git)                         TOP
//                           |
//    -----------------------------------------
//   /             |                \          \
// clone          push              add       commit      LEVEL 1
//   |           /    \            /    \       |
//  url      origin   remote    ref    name   message     LEVEL 2
//           /                  /\
//        path            remote  local                   LEVEL 3
//
// Given the above fictional subcommand hierarchy, valid runtime uses would be (not an all inclusive
// list):
//
// $ git clone url
// $ git push origin path
// $ git add ref local
// $ git commit message
//
// Notice only one command per "level" may be used. You could not, for example, do:
//
// $ git clone url push origin path
//
// It's also important to know that subcommands each have their own set of matches and may have args
// with the same name as other subcommands in a different part of the tree hierarchy (i.e. the arg
// names aren't in a flat namespace).
//
// In order to use subcommands in clap, you only need to know which subcommand you're at in your
// tree, and which args are defined on that subcommand.
//
// Let's make a quick program to illustrate. We'll be using the same example as above but for
// brevity sake we won't implement all of the subcommands, only a few.
