// In order to use YAML to define your CLI you must compile clap with the "yaml" feature because
// it's **not** included by default.
//
// In order to do this, ensure your Cargo.toml looks like one of the following:
//
// [dependencies.clap]
// features = ["yaml"]
//
// __OR__
//
// [dependencies]
// clap = { features = ["yaml"] }

// Using yaml requires calling a clap macro `load_yaml!()` so we must use the '#[macro_use]'
// directive

    // similar to how modules are found.
    //
    // Then we pass that yaml object to App to build the CLI.
    //
    // Finally we call get_matches() to start the parsing process. We use the matches just as we
    // normally would
    let yml = load_yaml!("17_yaml.yml");
